Hello, I'm Mostafa Salari. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Mazandaran University.

Since entering the world of programming and technology, I have always had a strong enthusiasm and motivation for learning and progressing. Among my main interests in these fields are machine learning, medical image processing, and Web Application Developing (Backend).

I am proficient in Python and C++ programming languages. These two programming languages are powerful tools that allow me to turn my creative ideas into reality and utilize them in the fields of machine learning and medical image processing, as you can find more details in my [CV](/cv/).

My experience encompasses developing a variety of open-source and commercial projects. These experiences have strengthened my ability to face various challenges and devise creative solutions for them. Additionally, projects in diverse fields such as medical image processing, the Morabaraba project, and the store project have prepared me to create innovative and practical solutions. Iâ€™ve put the source code and a short description of some of them on the [projects](/projects/) page.
