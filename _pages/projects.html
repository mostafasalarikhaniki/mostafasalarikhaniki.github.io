        One of the most intriguing applications of AI in our world is within the realm of gaming.
         I was particularly interested in integrating AI into a game that had not yet been thoroughly explored. Morabaraba,
          known as one of the most challenging games, posed a unique opportunity to incorporate artificial intelligence.
           I successfully implemented the Minimax algorithm within this game.

        I started the "imaginary-store" project to work with Django Rest Framework.
        For further practice, I implemented the entire database on Redis
